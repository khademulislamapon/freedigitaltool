                            <h2 className="space-y-2">Importance of Plagiarism detection</h2>
                            <p>
                                Whether you know it or not, plagiarism does affect you in some way. It doesn't matter whether you're the content creator or the one who consumes the content, plagiarism affects us all.
                                <br />
                                As a content creator (writer, author, researcher, student, freelancer, blogger, social media manager, etc. It's no news that you should be regularly checking to be sure that nobody is copying your content without your permission or giving you credit.
                                <br />
                                But much more than that, you also have to always run your content on a plagiarism detection tool before publishing or submitting it to be sure that your work does not contain plagiarism.
                                <br />
                                Why? Because plagiarism is an act of academic dishonesty, a breach of journalistic ethics, and above all, a publishing crime.
                                <br />
                                As such, you don't want to fall victim. If your work contains plagiarized content, whether intentionally or by ignorance, you stand to face serious penalties including:
                                <br />
                                <ul className="list-disc ml-10">
                                    <li>Legal actions</li>
                                    <li>Monetary restitution and fines</li>
                                    <li>Damaged reputation</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br />
                                This is not to mention other consequences like SEO content duplication penalties and lowered rankings, lost trust, possible academic sanctions, and more.
                                <br />
                                Now, on the other end of the spectrum, as a content consumer or user (reader, professor or teacher who vets students' work, client of freelance writers, etc.), it is equally important to check for plagiarism before accepting or taking action on any content you come across or submitted to you.
                                <br />
                                And that is why we created the Plagiarism Checker by Small SEO Tools.
                                <br />
